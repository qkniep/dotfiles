# macOS (Arch Linux) + Zsh + Vim

These are the settings I use as my development setup under both macOS and Arch Linux.
Currently this repo is under heavy development, anything can change at any time!

## Getting Started

To set up a new development environment on a machine run:
`bootstrap.sh`
The script's instructions will guide you through setting up folders, symlinking the dotfiles,
installing utility tools, and installing the development tools for languages you select.

## Roadmap

- [ ] add screenshots
- [x] set up denite.vim (https://github.com/ctaylo21/jarvis/blob/master/config/nvim/init.vim#L58)
- [ ] switch from airline to lightline (https://github.com/maximbaz/lightline-ale)
- [ ] make the installation script usable
- [ ] add getting-started instructions
- [ ] allow install script to setup tools for development (asking for languages)
- [ ] install fonts (Nerd Fonts) from install.sh
- [ ] set colorscheme in install.sh
- [ ] add complete list of installed software in this README
